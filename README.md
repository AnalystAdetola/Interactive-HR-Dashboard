# HR Dashboard - Interactive Human Resources Analytics

## Overview
As a fictitious HR manager, I created a comprehensive dashboard to analyze human resources data, providing both summary views for high-level insights and detailed employee records for in-depth analysis.

## Key Features

- **Summary Metrics:** Interactive visuals for key HR metrics, such as employee turnover, average tenure, and department-wise headcount.
- **Employee Records:** Detailed breakdown of individual employee data, including demographics, performance metrics, and tenure.
- **Filters & Interactivity:** Dynamic filters to slice data by department, role, and location, providing actionable insights tailored to specific needs.
- **Trend Analysis:** Visualized trends over time for recruitment, retention, and employee satisfaction.


## Technologies Used
- **Power BI** for data visualization and interactive dashboard creation.
- **Excel/Python** for data cleaning and preparation.

## How to Use
1. Open the dashboard in Power BI.
2. Use the filters to customize the view according to department, role, and location.
3. Explore insights on employee trends, retention, and performance.
